Curating Features
=================
Features are a top level entity in CIViC, enabling the classification of Variants into different classes.

Adding New Features

Features are added to CIViC primarily by the Add Evidence functionality. This functionality allows the curator to see if the Feature they want to curate for is already in CIViC, and additionally if the Variant associated to the Feature is already in the CIViC knowledgebase. When the Add Evidence functionality is used, the curator sees the Molecular Profile fields that can be curated. Recall that a Molecular Profile (MP) consists of one or more Feature-Variant pairs. Simple MPs hold one Feature-Variant pair (e.g. BRAF V600E), and Complex MPs are combinations of two or more Feature-Variant pairs (e.g. BRAF V600E AND MSI High). When adding a new Feature, the curator first chooses the Feature type (Gene, Factor, or Fusion). The curator then types in the adjacent field, and typeahead functionality searches through the existing Features to see if the desired Feature already exists. Typeahead results are displayed below the field. If the typeahead does not yield the desired Feature, the curator is prompted to make a new Feature, as shown below. Once the new or existing Feature is chosen, a similar process is followed for adding a new Variant associated to the Feature, to create the Feature-Variant pair. For Complex MPs, this process is repeated for each element of the complex MP (See section on curating MPs).

Revising Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like other CIViC entities, curators can click the Revise button in the upper right of the Feature’s page to create a revision, as seen in the images below. This will open up a set of fields which can be curated for the Feature. The fields that are available will be dependent on the type of Feature chosen (Gene, Factor, or Fusion). Note also that MPs consist of Feature-Variant pairs, and Variants also have curateable fields which depend on the Variant’s Feature type. Revising Variants is very similar to Revising Features, as each Variant has its own page, with a Revise button accessible on the upper right of the screen.
