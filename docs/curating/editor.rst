Becoming an Editor
==================

Once new content is generated or edits are made to existing content within the CIViC database, the additions/revisions will become visible (depending on user display preferences). However, the submission will be listed as a “submitted” or “pending” until it is accepted by an editor. CIViC editors must have attained a sufficient degree of relevant education (typically PhD or MD level), must be extensively familiar with the CIViC interface, have a demonstrated track record of successful curation within the database, and must have editor status approved by two existing editorial members.

**Recommended qualifications to become an editor:**

- Advanced degree in a relevant field

**Minimum qualifications to become an editor:**

- Advanced graduate student
- Publication record in relevant field
- Proven CIViC curation track record for promotion to editor:

  - At least 10 publication queue suggestions (Silver suggester badge)
  - Submit at least 10 revisions (at least 5 to gene or variant summaries) (Silver reviser badge)
  - Submit at least 10 new submitted evidence statements (5 must be accepted before promotion) (silver submitter badger)
  - Completed profile (Bronze biographer)
  - Review and understand CIViC help documentation

**Application process:**

- An existing curator is nominated or self-nominated by  `sending an email to the civic-help email list <mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC\ Help\ Editor>`_.

  - Please provide candidate's full name, affiliation, CV, contact info and CIViC profile id/name.

**Approval process:**

- At least 2 existing editorial members and one administrator will review application materials, profile, and CIViC curation track record, including review of submitted evidence, revisions, and publication.
- Application reviewers will agree to either promote, provisionally reject, or reject the application.
- A provisional rejection may be overcome if the curator demonstrates additional contributions in one of the categories above.
