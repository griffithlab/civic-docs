Curating Genes
==============

The CIViC Gene knowledge model provides summarized gene-level context for all CIViC variants contained by the gene.

For a gene record to become visible, it must be associated with at least one Evidence Item that describes a Molecular Profile (MP) consisting of one or a combination of multiple variants, where one of the MP variants is contained by the gene.

Genes are identified within CIViC using Entrez Gene names and IDs. Once a gene record exists it is automatically linked (via Entrez Gene) to additional gene-level details using the mygene.info resource and to the Drug Gene Interaction Database.

Finally, a high-level summary of the clinical relevance of the gene (as described by curated evidence/variants) can be curated along with supporting references (e.g., relevant reviews). Additional instruction on curating individual components of genes are provided in the :ref:`Knowledge Model docs for Genes <genes>` docs.

Genes are displayed on a page with a list of gene associated Molecular Profiles below the curator written gene Description. The page also contains a tab to see all of the gene associated variants (Figure 1).
