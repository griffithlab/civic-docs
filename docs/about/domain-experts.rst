Domain Experts
==============

Our Domain Experts serve a critical function in the CIViC community. Normally editor-level users, they are tasked with promoting and maintaining high quality data and interpretations in CIViC. Domain Experts are usually scientists or physician scientists, with advanced degrees (PhD or MD level), and demonstrated expertise (publication records) relevant to curation of knowledge for precision medicine in cancer. Domain Experts will typically take responsibility for curating the literature related to a specific cancer type, gene/pathway, or mutation type. They also are responsible for approving any new submissions or revisions from other curators in their domain area. Domain Experts come from two sources. First, individuals with established expertise in the field of precision medicine or domain expertise for a specific domain are identified and invited to join the CIViC community at the Domain Expert level. Alternatively, individuals may be promoted to Domain Expert level based on expertise demonstrated through an exceptional contribution history in CIViC.

   **Role:** Editor |br|
   **Area of Expertise:** Research Scientist

Dr. Danos is a Staff Scientist in the Griffith Lab, with research interests in developing data and knowledge models which can describe and give structure to clinical and preclinical cancer variant knowledge, and in developing standards to enable efficient trasnfer and communication of this information between groups who are generating and curating this data, as well as with the medical and research community at large, in order to address the curation bottleneck which has arisen with increasing incorporation of NGS technology into clinical as well as research contexts. Dr. Danos is also interested in elucidation of the regulatory structure of the genome, and the role of non-coding mutations in cancer.

   **Role:** Administrator |br|
   **Area of Expertise:** Research Scientist

Dr. Griffith is Associate Professor of Medicine and Assistant Director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine. He has worked in genomics and bioinformatics since the earliest phase of reference genome sequencing. He contributed to the Mammalian Gene Collection, producing some of the first full-length sequences for many human genes. He also was part of a small team of bioinformaticians that helped sequence and release the first whole genome reference sequence for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus at the height of the 2003 epidemic. He has contributed to the identification of molecular markers at the DNA, RNA and protein level that are useful for diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid, breast, lymphoma and other cancers. His lab’s research is focused on the development of informatics resources and personalized medicine strategies for cancer using genomic technologies. He is a co-creator of the CIViC resource.
