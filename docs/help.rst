Get Help
========

The best way to get help is by posting a `question on BioStars <https://www.biostars.org/t/civic/>`_ and tagging it
with 'civic'. Several members of the team monitor BioStars carefully and will
respond to your query.

Alternatively, you may `send an email to the civic-help email list <mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC\ Help\ Request>`_, to which
CIViC developers and researchers are all subscribed.

We'd prefer to use BioStars for technical support, since the resolution to any
issue will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.

Report a Problem
----------------
If you discover a bug or something isn't working quite right, we want to know
about it! Please `submit an issue to the civic-v2 github project
<https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-v2/issues>`_. We
monitor these issues closely and will be able to collaborate on getting the
problem resolved quickly.

If for some reason you do not wish to use github you may `send an email to the civic-help email list <mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC\ Help\ Request>`_, to which CIViC developers and researchers are all
subscribed.

We'd prefer to use Github for handling bugs, since the resolution to any issue
will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.
