Molecular Profiles
==================

Molecular Profiles (MPs) consist of a single Variant (simple MP) or a specific combination of more than one Variant (complex MP) related to a specific clinical outcome. New Molecular Profiles are created by the addition of a new Evidence Item associated with the Molecular Profile. If the component Variants of the Molecular Profile do not yet exist they also are created at this time.
