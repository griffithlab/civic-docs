NCCN Guideline
==============
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is a nonprofit collaboration of multiple cancer centers which contributes to research and education. NCCN maintains an influential set of detailed guidelines for the treatment of specific cancer types, which is regularly updated. CIViC integrates these and other guidelines into the curation process.

Understanding NCCN Guidelines
-----------------------------
NCCN and other guidelines contribute fundamentally to Assertions on multiple levels. If a given molecular profile (variant or combination of variants) and cancer type, for which the assertion is being prepared, appears in guidelines which are relevant to the field, and pertain to the Assertion Type which is being curated, then those guidelines should be cited in the Assertion (version and year).  

Curating NCCN Guidelines
------------------------
For many higher AMP-ASCO-CAP Tier (AMP Category on the interface) Assertions in CIViC, NCCN Guidelines may cover key clinical recommendations associated to the variant or Molecular Profile. When this is the case, the curator can cite the specific guideline that contains these recommndations, so that end users can explore these guidelines on their own if interested.
