The **Molecular Profile Name** describes the specific molecular profile being interpreted for clinical utility. Selecting a Molecular Profile Name in the Molecular Profile list for a Gene will bring up a Molecular Profile specific page with a description, aliases, molecular profile evidence score, details of underlying variant(s) and associated Evidence Items. 
 

Understanding Molecular Profile Names
---------------------------
The Molecular Profile Name concisely describes the gene/variant components which a define the molecular profile.


Adding New Molecular Profile Names
---------------------------
New CIViC Molecular Profile Names are entered into the database at the first instance of curation of evidence for the given molecular profile. At the time of entering an Evidence Item for a new molecular profile, the name is automatally generated from the specific variant components. For a simple molecular profile this only requires finding a single gene and then finding (or creating) the variant name. For a complex molecular profile each gene/variant is found individually and then an expression is constructed which describes the relationship between variants.
