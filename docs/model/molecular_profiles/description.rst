Description
===========
The Molecular Profile Description is a user-defined summary of the clinical relevance of the specific molecular profile.

The Molecular Profile Description should be a synthesis of the existing Evidence Statements for the Molecular Profile. Basic information on recurrence rates and biological/functional impact of the molecular profile may be included, but the focus should be on the clinical impact. Additionally, for molecular profiles involving predisposing variants, any appropriate American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) evidence codes can be recorded. Associated sources (PubMed IDs), including valuable review articles that might not be appropriate for the development of Evidence Items, may be used as references for the Molecular Profile Description.
