Evidence Score
==============
The Molecular Profile Evidence Score was developed to calculate the relative abundance of total available curated evidence for each Molecular Profile. The molecular profile evidence score reflects: 1) the strength of the evidence that was curated and 2) the total amount of curation that has been completed for each molecular profile.

This field is automatically generated, not curated.

.. rubric:: Understanding Evidence Scores

The Molecular Profile Evidence Score sums the Evidence Scores for all Evidence Items associated with the Molecular Profile. The Evidence Level score is a 10-point scale that weighs the evidence strength based on category. Broadly, highest points are awarded to large clinical studies and lower points are awarded to case studies, in vitro studies, and inferential evidence. Evidence Item Scores are calculated by multiplying a weighted Trust Rating (i.e., one point for each star) by the values assigned to Evidence Level (i.e., A=10, B=5, C=3, D=1, E=0.5). The Molecular Profile Evidence Score is a relative measure of the total amount of curation in the database for a specific molecular profile and does not take into account conflicting evidence.
