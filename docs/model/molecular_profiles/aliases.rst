Aliases
=======
Molecular Profile Aliases are alternative names, descriptions, or identifiers that differ from the primary CIViC Molecular Profile Name. The primary Molecular Profile name is created automatically from its component (Gene Variant) parts. For example, a Molecular Profile Name might look like: "DNMT3A R882 AND FLT3 ITD". However, many such Molecular Profiles may also be known by more common terms. Aliases may also represent alternate (Equivalent) expressions of complex molecular profiles (e.g., with different ordering of component variants or sets of variants). 

These terms are manually curated and are incorporated into the search fields within the CIViC interface.
