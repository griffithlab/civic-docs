Aliases
=======
Variant Aliases are alternative names, descriptions, or identifiers that differ from the primary CIViC Variant Name and are used to describe alternate names for a variant. Variants may be known by more colloquial terms, amino acid positions that reference transcripts of a different length, alternative IDs, etc. which can be captured here. For example, `MTHFR A222V <https://civicdb.org/links/variant/258>`_ is also known as rs1801133, C677T, and Ala222Val.

These terms are manually curated and are incorporated into the search fields within the CIViC interface. Aliases may include protein changes on alternative transcripts (e.g., D754Y for *ERBB2* D769Y), dbSNP IDs, COSMIC IDs or other identifiers used in the literature.
