In order to browse the selection of Features that have been curated in CIViC, a user can simply use the left menu selection in the user interface, and click on the Features button as outlined in red in the figure below. After that, the Feature Browse table is shown. This table shows Genes by default. Other Features may be selected to view by utilizing the Feature Type pulldown menu with the green outline around it in the figure.

This browse view also displays other useful fields associated with the given Feature, including Full Name, which is helpful particularly for Factors which often are abbreviations, such as TMB for Tumor Mutation Burden, and CK for Complex Karyotype. Curated Aliases as well as Evidence-associated Diseases and Therapies curated for the given Feature are also shown. In addition, the count of curated Evidence Items, number of Variants, Assertions, and Molecular Profiles associated with the Feature are shown.

Users should also keep in mind that Molecular Profiles, Features, and Variants are almost always clickable in the CIViC interface, and will bring you to the page for the entity of interest. Hovering over these entities can show additional data and right clicking can bring up a menu, allowing users to open a new tab or window for the entity of interest, keeping the old page open as well.
