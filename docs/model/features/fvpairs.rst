Feature-Variant Pairs
=====================



Feature-Variant pairs are a basic unit in CIViC, which consist of a Feature and Variant, which associate naturally, such as BRAF V600E, or BCR::ABL1 Fusion. When Feature-Variant pairs are shown in the CIViC user interface, each entity is clickable, and will bring the use to the respective Feature or Variant which was clicked. The Variant in a Feature-Variant pair is associated exclusively to the given Feature, but the Feature may be associated to more than one Variant (there are no limitations on how many Variants a Feature can have, for instance BRAF can have arbitrarily many Variants associated to it. Examples of Feature-Variant pairs in CIViC are shown below.
