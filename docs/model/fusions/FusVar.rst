Fusion Variant Page
===================

Each Variant associated to a Feature has its own Variant page, and this holds for Variants associated to Fusions, since Fusions are a type of Feature. Variant pages have a different format depending on the type of Feature that the Variant is associated to. Fusion Variant pages have a number of structured fields described in the figure below. Importantly, at the bottom of Fusion Variant pages a list is shown that contains all Molecular Profiles (MPs) that contain the Variant as one of their constituent Feature-Variant pairs. In the example below, the list shows all Molecular Profiles that contain the Feature-Variant pair BCR::ABL1 Fusion. Examples include **BCR::ABL1 Fusion AND ABL1 T315I**, as well as the Simple MP **BCR::ABL1 Fusion**.
