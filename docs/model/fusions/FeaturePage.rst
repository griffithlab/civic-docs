Fusion Feature page
===================

In the CIViC user interface, each Feature has its own page. Therefore, each Fusion has its own page in CIViC, with multiple curatable fields. Feature pages for Fusions have a distinct layout. They contain a curator written Description for the Fusion. In addition, they import curator written Descriptions from the Gene Feature pages that comprise the Fusion. At the bottom of the page Molecular Profiles (MPs) involving this Feature are listed. MPs are comprised of one or more Feature-Variant pairs.

   :title: Figure 1: The Fusion Feature page contains a curator-written Description for the given Fusion on the upper left. Below that are Curator written Description fields for each Gene in the Fusion. These Descriptions are imported from each Gene Feature page. At the bottom of the page are listed the Molecular Profiles (MPs) that contain the specific Fusion (BCR::ABL1 in this case). These MPs can also contain other Features if they are complex MPs, which are comprised of more than one Feature Variant pair.

At the bottom of the Fusion page a Variant tab is also shown. Clicking on the tab will reveal the curated Variants associated to the given Fusion. For most Fusions, only the “Fusion” Variant will be listed. In the example below, EML4::ALK, evidence for multiple Variants was curated - both for the Fusion categorical (bucket) Variant, and for Variants with specific exon combinations.

   :title: Figure 2: At the bottom of the Feature page for a specified Fusion, the MPs containing that Fusion are listed in the default view. Users can also click the Variants tab, and see the list of Variants that are associated to that specific Fusion. The example pictured is taken from the bottom of the EML4::ALK Feature page. When the Variants tab is clicked, a list of Variants that have been curated for EML4::ALK is displayed. For many Fusions, only the general Fusion bucket Variant type has been curated. In the case of EML4::ALK, multiple exon specific Variants have been curated (e.g. exon 20 of EML4 joined to exon 20 of ALK), and are listed on the Feature page.
