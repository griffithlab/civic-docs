Clinical Trial
==============
Clinical Trial ID is associated with an Evidence Item in an automated fashion. If a CIViC Evidence item shows a Clinical Trial ID, then that Clinical Trial ID is found on the PubMed page for that Evidence Source. Following the link in CIViC for the Trial ID brings the user to the corresponding clinicaltrials.gov page for the trial. This field is not accessible to direct curation.

The current Clinical Trials associated with Evidence and Sources in CIViC can be explored on the `CIViC Clinical Trials Page <https://civicdb.org/clinical-trials/home>`__.
