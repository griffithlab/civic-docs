Source
======
An evidence item summarizes one specific source publication.

Understanding Source
--------------------
Each Evidence Item must be associated with a Source Type and Source ID, which link the Evidence Item to the original publication supporting clinical claims. Currently, CIViC accepts publications indexed on PubMed or abstracts published through the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). If a PubMed Source Type is selected, the curator can then enter the PubMed ID, which can be verified by comparing the desired source to the abbreviated citation that is automatically generated below the PubMed ID field. If an ASCO Source Type is selected, the ASCO Web ID should be entered into the source ID field. Additionally, ClinicalTrials Registry Number(s) are automatically linked via the PubMed database, when available.

Curating Source
---------------
All curated CIViC Evidence, Assertions, Variant Summaries, and Gene Summaries are based on cited sources from the biomedical literature, currently limited to those publications indexed in PubMed or the ASCO Meeting Library. As soon as any publication is cited in CIViC it appears as a separate Source Record and can be browsed or searched within the CIViC knowledgebase. Each Source Record includes details about the publication as well as a table linking to all CIViC evidence curated for that source.

Comments can be added to any Source Record at any time (see Figure 1). Source comments are a useful place to document general or specific notes to aid current and future curation. For example, if a source has an overlapping patient population with another study already curated within CIViC, this can be documented. In other cases, the reference sequence used for determining the CIViC Variant’s coordinates might be recorded.

Source comments are a useful place to note study overlap with other literature, for instance if a family reported in a study has been reported in other publications.
