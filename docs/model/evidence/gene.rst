Gene
====
The Gene Name identifies the gene(s) associated with a Molecular Profile (simple or complex variant) implicated by the Evidence Item.

Curating Genes
--------------
Gene Names are associated with evidence through their inclusion in the associated Molecular Profile (MP). Each Evidence Item must be associated with an MP and each MP must have one or more gene and variant. The CIViC Gene Name utilizes the HGNC official gene symbol as provided by Entrez, where applicable, which are approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). As the MP (Simple or Complex) is created, the Gene Name field will auto-fill using type-ahead search for genes in the Entrez database or their associated Aliases. Curators must enter a valid Entrez Gene Name (e.g., TP53) and should verify the correct entry against the Entrez Gene ID automatically displayed by the CIViC interface. Alternative Gene Names (Aliases/Synonyms) are imported from Entrez and are searchable throughout the database.
