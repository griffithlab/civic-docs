Type
====
The Evidence Type refers to the type of clinical (or biological) association described by the Evidence Item’s clinical summary.

Understanding Evidence Types
----------------------------
Six Evidence Types are currently supported: Predictive (i.e. Therapeutic), Diagnostic, Prognostic, Predisposing, Oncogenic, and Functional. Each Evidence Type describes the clinical or biological effect a variant has on the following: therapeutic response (Predictive), determining a patient’s diagnosis or disease subtype (Diagnostic), predicting disease progression or patient survival (Prognostic), disease susceptibility (Predisposing), or biological alterations relevant to a cancer phenotype (Oncogenic) or protein function (Functional). Selecting an Evidence Type has implications on available selections for Clinical Significance.
