Direction
=========
Evidence Direction indicates if the Evidence Statement supports or refutes the significance of an event. 

Understanding Evidence Direction
--------------------------------
The available options include: “Supports” or “Does Not Support”. Nuanced examples for how to correctly use the Evidence Direction for Predictive Evidence Types are shown in the :ref:`section on curating Evidence Items <curating-evidence>`. 

Curating Evidence Direction
---------------------------
Evidence Direction interpretation differs slightly depending on the Evidence Type.
