Direction
=========
Evidence Direction indicates if the Evidence Statement supports or refutes the significance of an event. 

Understanding Evidence Direction
--------------------------------
The available options include: “Supports” or “Does Not Support”. Nuanced examples for how to correctly use the Evidence Direction for Predictive Evidence Types are shown in the :ref:`section on curating Evidence Items <curating-evidence>`. 

Curating Evidence Direction
---------------------------
Evidence Direction interpretation differs slightly depending on the Evidence Type.

   * - Direction
     - Symbol
     - Definition
   * - Supports
     - |thumbs-up|
     - The experiment or study supports this variant’s response to a drug
   * - Does not support
     - |thumbs-down|
     - The experiment or study does not support, or was inconclusive of an interaction between the variant and a drug

     - |thumbs-up|
     - The experiment or study supports variant’s impact on the diagnosis of disease or subtype
   * - Does not support

     - The experiment or study supports a variant’s impact on prognostic outcome
   * - Does not support
     - |thumbs-down|
     - The experiment or study does not support a prognostic association between variant and outcome
