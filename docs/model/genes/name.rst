Gene Name
=========

The CIViC Gene Name utilizes official Entrez Gene Names from the Entrez Gene database.

Understanding Gene Names
------------------------

The CIViC Gene Name utilizes official Entrez Gene Names from the Entrez Gene database, which are approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). Curators must enter a valid Entrez Gene Name (e.g., TP53) and should verify the correct entry against the Entrez Gene ID automatically displayed by the CIViC interface. Alternative Gene Names (Aliases/Synonyms) are imported from Entrez and are searchable throughout the database.

Curating Gene Names
-------------------

Only Entrez Gene Names are accepted for the CIViC Gene Name field. Curators should verify the correct entry against the Entrez Gene ID automatically displayed by the CIViC interface.
