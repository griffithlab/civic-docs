Summary
=======

The CIViC Gene Summary provides a high-level overview of clinical relevance of cancer variants for the gene.

Understanding Gene Summaries
----------------------------

A CIViC Gene Summary should be created to provide a high-level overview of clinical relevance of cancer variants for the gene. Gene Summaries should focus on emphasizing the clinical relevance from a molecular perspective and should not describe the biological function of the gene unless necessary to contextualize its clinical relevance in cancer. Gene Summaries should include relevant cancer subtypes, specific treatments for the gene’s associated variants, pathway interactions, functional alterations caused by the variants in the gene, and normal/abnormal functions of the gene with associated roles in oncogenesis. A CIViC Gene Summary should generally be limited to one or two paragraphs and cite relevant reviews to further support the gene’s clinical relevance in cancer.

Curating Gene Summaries
----------------------------

The Gene Summary is a user-defined description of the clinical relevance of this gene. Just as a Molecular Profile Summary should be a synthesis of Evidence Statements for a Molecular Profile, the Gene Summary should be a synthesis of the Molecular Profile Summaries for a Gene.

This summary should also discuss the relevance of the Gene to different cancer types, patient outcomes and treatment decisions, and highlight differences and similarities between different variants of this gene or different molecular profiles involving this gene. This section may include information about the gene product’s pathway interactions, functional alterations caused by variants within this gene and normal functions that are relevant to its association with cancer. Although individual evidence statements do not capture biological/mechanistic impact of variants on gene function, the Gene Summary is a place where this information may be summarized.

A CIViC Gene Summary should generally be limited to one or two paragraphs and cite relevant reviews for a more extensive discussion of clinical relevance of the gene in cancer.

.. rubric:: Sources

Although in-line citations are not currently supported, citations can be tracked using the Sources field and entered by specifying the PubMed ID associated with the publication. The addition of citations used to generate the gene description, particularly relevant reviews, is highly encouraged with the intention of directing users to more in-depth information.

The sources used for Gene Summaries should be derived from Pubmed and, unlike typical CIViC Evidence Items, may include review articles.
