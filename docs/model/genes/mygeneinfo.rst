Understanding MyGene.info
-------------------------

Automatic linkouts to MyGene.info are generated for each gene record within the CIViC interface. This field includes the full gene name, the Entrez Symbol, the Entrez ID, alternative aliases, the genomic coordinates, protein domains, and associated pathways. The field also provides a link to the full MyGene.info details.
