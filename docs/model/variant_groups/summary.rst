Summary
=======

Variant Groups provide user-defined grouping of Variants within and between genes based on unifying characteristics.

Understanding Variant Group Summaries
-------------------------------------

This is a user-defined description of the clinical relevance of this variant group. This description should include the rationale for grouping these variants together, summarize their relevance to cancer diagnosis, prognosis or treatment and highlight any treatments or cancers of particular relevance. Cancers or treatments where grouping this set of variants is not appropriate should also be highlighted.

Curating Variant Group Summaries
--------------------------------

Although in-line citations are not currently supported, the addition of citations used to generate the variant group description, particularly relevant reviews, is highly encouraged with the intention of directing other users to more in-depth information. Citations can be added using the Sources field and entered by specifying the PubMed ID associated with the publication.
