This is a user-defined description of the clinical relevance of this variant group. This description should include the rationale for grouping these variants together, summarize their relevance to cancer diagnosis, prognosis or treatment and highlight any treatments or cancers of particular relevance. Cancers or treatments where grouping this set of variants is not appropriate should also be highlighted.

Curating Summary
