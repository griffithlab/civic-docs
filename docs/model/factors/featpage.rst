The Factor Page View
====================


Just as with Genes and all Feature types in CIViC, each Factor has its own Feature page. The page contains a curator-written description of the Factor. Each Factor is associated with an NCIT term, in order to integrate these entities in CIViC to a larger ontology. Therefore each Factor Feature page has its own NCIT link, which is added by the curator. Aliases for the Factor are another curated field. Importantly, the bottom part of the Factor page lists all Molecular Profiles (MPs) that have the given Factor in one of their constituent Feature-Variant pairs, for which Evidence Items (EIDs) have been curated.

   :title: Figure 1: Each Factor has its own page. The page contains a link and imported data from the NCI Thesaurus. Factors generally have a short name that is optimized for display in various parts of the CIViC interface (e.g. TMB), and also have a long name, which will often spell out the abbreviated name (e.g. Tumor Mutational Burden). The page also contains a curator written Description, along with source links for literature used. Aliases are also displayed. At the bottom of the page a list of all the Molecular Profiles (MPs) is shown, which contain the specific factor in one of their Feature-Variant pairs. Clicking on an MP will bring the user to the specific page for that MP, where all Evidence Items (EIDs) associated to that MP are shown.

Clicking on one of the Molecular Profiles (MPs), such as **MSI High**, at the bottom of the Factor page for MSI shown above, will open up the corresponding Molecular Profile page. The Molecular Profile page lists information on the Factor-Variant pair  including a curator-written description, and importantly, this page lists all the Evidence Items (EIDs) and Assertions (AIDs) that have been curated for the MP.

   :title: Figure 2: The page for the simple Molecular Profile (MP) is shown, which consists of the single Feature-Variant pair MSI High. A curator description is shown, and at the bottom of the page the Evidence Items (EIDs) are shown that have been curated for MSI High. Also at the bottom of the page Assertions that have been curated for MSI High are shown.

Note that complex MPs containing the Factor-Variant together with other Feature-Variant pairs also each have their own page. Below the complex MP page for **BRAF V600E AND MSI Low** is shown.

   :title: Figure 3: The page for a complex MP is shown. The page contains a curator written description, and information from each constituent Variant is imported and displayed on the page as well. Evidence Items curated for the complex MP are shown at the bottom of the page.
