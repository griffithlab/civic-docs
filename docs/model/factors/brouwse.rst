Browsing Factors
================

Factors can be browsed in the Features browse table. To the left of the screen in the CIViC user interface are various selections which can be made by users. If the user selects the Features entry on that menu, then a browse table with a list of Features is shown. If the user selects “Factor” in the dropdown called Type, then the list is filtered to only show Factors that have been curated in CIViC.
