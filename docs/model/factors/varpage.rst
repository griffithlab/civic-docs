The Factor Variant Page
=======================

There is also a page in the CIViC UI specifically for each Variant. The page for the Variant “High”, associated to the Factor-Variant pair TMB High, is shown below. Note that Variants associated with Factors do not have fields for coordinate curation the way that Gene-associated Variants do because they may impact multiple or non-specific genomic loci. Each Variant associated to a Factor can also be optionally linked to an NCIT term, but it is not required the way that an NCIT link is required for each Factor.

   :title: Figure 1: Every Variant in CIViC has its own page. In this case the Variant page for the High Variant is shown, which is associated to the Factor TMB. Variant pages for Factors have an optional NCI thesaurus link, and fields for aliases. At the bottom of the Variant page, a list of Molecular Profiles is shown which contain the Factor-Variant pair as one of their constituent Feature-Variant pairs. In this case only the trivial simple MP TMB High is shown, as no complex MPs have yet to be curated which contain TMB High.
