Features
========

In the CIViC data model, Features are a top level entity, and Variants are associated with Features. Types of Features supported by CIViC include: Genes, Fusions, and Factors, discussed further below. Features were introduced to broaden the types of Variants for which CIViC curation can be performed beyond Gene-based variants exclusively. 

The motivation for addition of Features emerges from considering that cancer biomarkers with clinical impact are not always directly associated to genes: 

- High Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H) can be associated with positive prognostic outcome in colorectal cancer
- High Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) can be sensitizing to pembrolizumab in solid tumors
- HPV infection in cervical cancer can have prognostic value dependent on HPV subtype
