CIViC API
=========

V2 API
------

The V2 API documentation can be found `here <https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-v2/>`_.

Our full API documentation can be found `on GitHub <https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-v2/>`_.

We've developed `a graphical user interface <https://civicdb.org/api/graphiql>`_ for accessing the new API, including a set of useful example queries.

A set of example usage scripts of the API in Python, R, and Ruby can be found on our `GitHub repo <https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-v2/tree/main/examples>`_.

for these purposes.
