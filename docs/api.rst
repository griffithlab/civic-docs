CIViC API
=========

V2 API
------

In April 2022 CIViC V2 was launched, which includes a new GraphQL API. The
old API is still available at v1.civicdb.org/api. It accesses a frozen
datadump and does not include any new data since the switchover. While we
expect the V1 API to be accessible for a few more months (deprecation date
forthcoming) any new integrations should use the V2 API and existing
integrations should switch to the V2 API as soon as possible. Please contact
us at help@civicdb.org for assistance.

The V2 documentation can be found `here <https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-v2/>`_.

A graphical userface for accessing the new API can be found `in the API docs
<https://civicdb.org/api/graphiql>`_.

Please stay tuned for a more comprehensive API user guide.
